These questions are from @gebru2021datasheets.

**Motivation**

1.  *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    -   The dataset was created to facilitate the investigation of the effects of the 2024 US Presidential Election, on crude oil prices, with the specific aim of identifying any possible correlations, causal linkages, or patterns that might emerge throughout the election season. This dataset addresses the gap in structured, comprehensive data that combines political events and economic indicators to model their impact on crude oil price fluctuations.
2.  *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    -   The dataset was sourced from the US Energy Information Administration data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database."Crude Oil Prices: West Texas Intermediate (WTI)" was the exact series. The data was collected for the historical period of October 1st to November 18th, 2024, to facilitate analysis of the potential effects of the 2024 US Presidential Election on crude oil prices.
3.  *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    -   The dataset titled "Crude Oil Prices: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) - Cushing, Oklahoma" (DCOILWTICO) is produced by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis provides access to this dataset through its FRED platform.
4.  *Any other comments?*
    -   This dataset offers a reliable source of historical data on crude oil prices, guaranteeing accuracy and consistency for analysis. In order to capture possible market movements before and after the US Presidential Election in 2024, the time range was selected. It is crucial to remember that the dataset only contains data on crude oil prices; it does not take into consideration other macroeconomic variables that could have an impact on price changes over the same time frame. A more thorough examination might call for more datasets.

**Composition**

1.  *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
    -   The dataset's examples reflect West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices on a daily basis, expressed in US dollars per barrel. Every occurrence relates to a particular date in the historical period between October 1st and November 18th, 2024. There are no other entities or interactions in the dataset; it only includes one type of instance (daily price records).
2.  *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
    -   The dataset contains a total of 35 instances. All 35 instances in the DCOILWTICO column are valid and have been successfully converted to numeric values, with no missing or invalid entries detected.
3.  *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
    -   A subset of the daily crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) that are accessible through the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database are included in the dataset. In particular, it spans the time frame around the 2024 US Presidential Election, which falls between October 1st and November 18th, 2024. Although this sample is indicative of changes in the price of crude oil within this particular time frame, it does not capture long-term patterns or the whole historical range of WTI prices. The sample's representativeness is adequate for examining the immediate effects of political developments during the chosen time period.
4.  *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
    -   West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil's daily closing price in US dollars per barrel is the "raw" data that makes up each instance in the dataset. A date and the associated price for that day are included in each row. Since the data hasn't been altered or manipulated, it accurately represents the values found in the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database. It is appropriate for additional processing, analysis, and modeling because of its raw format.
5.  *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   There is no explicit label or target associated with each instance. Each instance represents a recorded crude oil price for a specific date, with the date serving as the primary identifier. If the dataset is used for predictive modeling or analysis, the crude oil price itself could be treated as the target variable in such contexts.
6.  *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
    -   No information appears to be missing from the dataset. Each instance includes a date and the corresponding crude oil price for that day, as provided by the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database. However, if any dates are missing from the dataset, it would likely be because no trading data was recorded on those days (e.g., weekends or holidays when markets are closed).
7.  *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
    -   No explicit relationships between individual instances are made in the dataset. Each instance is an independent record of the crude oil price for a specific date, with no direct connections or interactions indicated between the records. However, implicit relationships, such as sequential price trends over time, can be inferred by analyzing the data chronologically.
8.  *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
    -   No specific data splits are recommended for this dataset as provided. However, for modeling or analysis purposes, users may choose to split the dataset into subsets such as training, validation, and testing. For example, the data from October 1st to October 31st could be used for training, while the data from November 1st to November 18th could serve as validation and testing sets. This split ensures that the model can be evaluated on unseen data to assess its performance and generalizability. The rationale for such splits would depend on the specific objectives of the analysis, such as predicting future crude oil prices or understanding trends.
9.  *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   The dataset is sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database, which is a reputable source for economic and financial data. As such, it is unlikely to contain significant errors or redundancies. However, potential sources of noise could include daily market volatility, external geopolitical events, or macroeconomic factors that may influence crude oil prices but are not directly reflected in the dataset. These factors could add variability to the data that might be mistaken for trends or patterns unless properly accounted for in the analysis.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
    -   The dataset is self-contained in its downloaded form but originates from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database, which serves as an external source. The FRED database is a widely used and reliable source for economic data. While there is no absolute guarantee that the dataset will remain accessible in its current form indefinitely, FRED has a history of maintaining its datasets over time. Users are encouraged to download and archive the dataset for long-term use. Additionally, FRED maintains historical records, allowing users to access data as it was available at a specific point in time. However, no official archival mechanism is provided with the downloaded dataset to ensure it reflects the state of the data as of a particular date. The dataset is publicly available and does not have associated licensing fees or restrictions. However, users should review the FRED terms of use (https://research.stlouisfed.org/legal) to ensure compliance, particularly if the data is being used for commercial purposes.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   The dataset does not contain data that might be considered confidential. It solely includes publicly available daily crude oil price information, which is not protected by legal privilege or confidentiality agreements. The data pertains to market prices and does not involve any personal, private, or sensitive information about individuals.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
    -   The dataset does not contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or cause anxiety. It strictly includes daily crude oil prices, which are neutral economic indicators and do not involve sensitive, controversial, or inflammatory content.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
    -   The dataset does not identify any sub-populations. It solely consists of daily crude oil prices without any demographic or individual-level data such as age, gender, or other identifiers. The dataset represents aggregate market information and does not provide any breakdowns or distributions related to specific groups or sub-populations.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
    -   It is not possible to identify individuals, either directly or indirectly, from the dataset. The data consists solely of aggregated daily crude oil prices and does not include any personal, demographic, or identifying information about natural persons.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   The dataset does not contain data that might be considered sensitive.
